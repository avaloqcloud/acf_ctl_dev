# Avaloq Cloud Framework

The Avaloq Cloud Framework (ACF) is a collection of deployment scripts that connect cloud services running on Azure, AWS or Google with applications running on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).

## Development Module
The development version of the core module enables operations engineers to develop a set of deployment parameter and the respective resource configurations without appplying these configuration in deployment scripts. It acclerates the development process, because engineers can create and check the valid output against the service provider definitions without invoking the cloud controller.
